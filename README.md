# My-Project

I used this commands:
    git config
    git init
    git status
    git add . 
    git commit -m "güncellendi"
    git push -u origin main
    git push
    git remote add path
    git clone path
    cd

    ı use the commit comment when my project is done
    we can create a folder and make changes abour its properties.When we uplod the file to github with git we can save in long term.
    ı used the git add . for remove to stage are after that ı used the git commit -m "massege" for remove to local repository

    sometimes  my codes didn't work ı take the errors but when ı open the terminal again its fixed
